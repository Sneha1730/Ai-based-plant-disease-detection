                <h3>Apple</h3>
                <p>Apple trees need regular watering, especially during dry spells, and well-draining soil to avoid root rot. They also need to be pruned regularly, especially to remove dead or broken branches, and mulched to retain moisture. Proper support, companion planting (with appropriate cultivars), and pest control are also important for healthy apple trees. </p>

                <h3>Potato</h3>
                <p>Potatoes need full sun and well-drained soil. They also prefer soil with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5 (slightly acidic). If you're growing potatoes in containers, ensure the pots are at least 12 inches deep.</p>

                <p>They need full sun (at least 7 hours daily), well-drained soil, and regular watering, especially during the first few years and during dry periods. Pruning is essential, especially in the first few years to encourage root development, and should be done in late winter. Protecting young vines from birds and controlling pests is also important. </p>
